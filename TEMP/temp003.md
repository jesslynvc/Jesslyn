## Create a .env File
​
Using the .env.example file as a template, create a .env file.
​
Then input your Kintone credentials like the following:
​
VITE_APITOKEN=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
VITE_SUBDOMAIN=example
VITE_APPID=1
​
VITE_SUBDOMAIN = "example"
VITE_APPID = "1"
VITE_APITOKEN = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
​
⚠️ DO NOT DELETE THE .env.example FILE!
.env.example is used by env-cmd to verify that .env file is correctly configured.

> Would I put  dynamic “exceptions’  to incoming data in the env file?   Or is it all static coding so that if something is “non-structured”, is just bombs-out?
​
.env file is for storing credentials and environment variables. (i.e., API tokens, passwords, etc.)
​
Anything beyond that does not belong in the .env.
​
Instead filter in the backend setup OR the database (ex/ Kintone permissions)
