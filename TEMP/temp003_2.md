## Grab the Login Credentials, View ID, and App ID
=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Where to get the Subdomain, View ID, and App ID?

- Go to your Kintone App's custom view & grab the URL
- Kintone App's URL follows this template:
https://<SUBDOMAIN>.kintone.com/k/<App ID>/?view=<View ID>

Example:

- https://example.kintone.com/k/1/?view=1234
- Subdomain = example
- KINTONE_BASE_URL = https://example.kintone.com
- App ID = 1
- View ID = 1234

## Create a .env File
‚Äã=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Using the .env.example file as a template, create a .env file.
‚Äã
Then input your Kintone credentials like the following:
‚Äã
KINTONE_BASE_URL="example"
KINTONE_USERNAME="your username"
KINTONE_PASSWORD="your password"
VIEW_ID="the view ID from your View"
‚Äã
‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT DELETE THE .env.example FILE!
.env.example is used by env-cmd to verify that .env file is correctly configured.

## Update customize-manifest.json with App ID
=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Update customize-manifest.json with App ID

The Kintone Customize Uploader uses customize-manifest.json to determine where to upload the JavaScript file (which Kintone App).

{
    "app": "1",
    "scope": "ALL",
    ...
    
If this is NOT your first Kintone App, update the app value to your App ID.

## Editing index.js - Input Kintone data into the chart
=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Editing index.js - Input Kintone data into the chart
File: /src/index.js

- We access the database records from Kintone's event.records object.
- We will map the event.records object into an object for amCharts to parse.
- Below is a basic mapping function, with Kintone's records designated as the rec object.
- Kintone's records follow a structure of objectName.fieldCode.value
- Example: To access the First Name value of a Kintone record, we will write it as:
rec.first.value => George (Washington)

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

## Solutions:
=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Solutions for the coding

// TODO: Input Kintone data into the chart
chart.data = event.records.map((rec, index) => {
  return {
    // TODO: Text above the PinBullet; President's name
    'text': rec.first.value,
    // TODO: PinBullet's & time period's color; Party color
    'color': partyColor[rec.party.value],
    // TODO: Time period's start; Term's start
    'start': rec.start.value,
    // TODO: Time period's end; Term's end
    'end': rec.end.value,
    // TODO: Icon inside the PinBullet; President's icon
    'icon': rec.image.value,
    'category': '' // Timeline category; leave as empty string
  }
});
